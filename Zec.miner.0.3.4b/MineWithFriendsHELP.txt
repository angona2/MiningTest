Welcome to the alpha testing stages of Mine With Friends.

You will find installation directions below, follow them VERY closely. The current implementation is for a small
 group of users for statistical analysis so the program isn't "1 click" user-friendly quite yet, but it is still
 quite easy.

**Make sure you install the files I provide FIRST**

1. Double click the java file "Zclassic". This will create a zclassic wallet for you so you can store your own coins.
	**The wallet will need to synchronize, this can take a lot of time.**

2. Once you are in "Zclassic Swing Wallet UI 0.58 (beta)" click on the tab "Own addresses" and copy the address which
 looks something like this... t1ZbFYip9uEaCqughVbWbasrMAwtPv2hz8q - write this down or save it in a word doc just in case

3. Right click the windows batch file "start" and select "edit"

4. Once in the file you should see where to put your wallet address, remove the text and paranthesis I put in and replace
 with your wallet address.
	Example: miner --server 45.55.45.68 --port 3032 --user t1VMhhXd9nVHkMVKja86MCKgEXSqooWF91x --pass x

5. Click on "File" and "Save"

6. Now simply double click start and you will be mining with friends!!
